# Seismic_Japan

TLDR - Exploration of global earthquake data. Payoff is a 3D model of the subterrainean seismic shelf beneath Japan.

Besides wrangling & consistency checks in Python, I also performed:
  * data sourcing
  * geospatial analysis (using shapefiles)
  * regression analysis
  * cluster analysis
  * time-series analysis

Curated results are avaiable in this dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/EarthlyJapan/SeismicDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
