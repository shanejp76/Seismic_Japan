# Seismic_Japan

> TLDR - Exploration of global earthquake data. Payoff is a 3D model of the subterrainean shelf beneath Japan.


This project started as a challenge in predicting the 'when' & 'where' mechanics of earthquakes. 

Besides the necessary wrangling & consistency checks in Python, I also performed:
  * data sourcing
  * geospatial analysis (using shapefiles)
  * regression analysis
  * cluster analysis
  * time-series analysis
